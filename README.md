# Zinc Finger Protein Finger

The premise is simple, you feed the program a .txt file containing genome sequences and it will dice it up into even lines for ingestion.

From there, the sequence will be cut up into an array and saved for printing later.

The program will then locate any given zinc finger from the regular expression given and print out the following:
-The site
-the location
-the sequence array

Formatting will dictate that there will be a new line between each split.
The location of the zinc finger will be highlighted in the line below the sequence where it's found based on its index position and length.
